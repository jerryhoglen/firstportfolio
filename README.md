# firstportfolio 
This is the first project that I created in the Careerfoundry web development boot camp! This project was all about building a responsive web site. This portfolio website includes features I learned to code throughout the Exercises. I have successfully implemented interactive HTML5 elements with semantic tags in my website, including footers, forms, embeds, modal windows, and tooltips. I have installed jQuery plugins for advanced functionality by linking script files in my HTML file, as well as writing JavaScript directly within script tags. I have revised the CSS file for efficiency and organization.
